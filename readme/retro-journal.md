Today i actualy shoped wireframing tools instead of hand drawing them on my tablet and i like some of the sofwares but the seem very browser dependant sadly... i can do much the same things with gimp however i found cacoo.. not abad one neither is ninja..  im still on the fence untill i can get the full versions from an future employer or pay.

i feel like i have a good foundation to spring in to code tomorrow and but may start my day working on some more ground work like a flow chart for the db and api calls and how i want the data to flow... i think i need to white board that one and then clean it up in cacoo.com

Today was tricky authorization is fun but hard i know im pushing topics i have yet to cover but i want this to work so i will put the time and energy into making this work so i have a good head start at 401 in december.
i feel i did a lot of solid work in my views today got some simple js work10-08-2020 12:00ing with a slide show and a few menu transitions for mobile design.

all in all a good programing day i got a lot of headway to my auth system. need to make a login prompt for existing users either a page or a on page prompt that changes.... that is something to look in to is chaning an element on login..

i think tomorrow will be api calls for the recipes and userdata handling.

Today was a better day than yesterday on this. after doing user auth the hard and long way my self with a db on psql i moved my auth process to auth0 with relitive ease. took me about 4 hours to get my head around it though im excited to say i have good working (ithink) auth process through them the trick will be how to intigrate spotifys client id. so i can hit thier api for music later... but i have other things to focus on first... to day set me up to work forward and get my api and major site functionality in tomorrow and tuseday. followed and paired with css work to clean this up and potentialy have a MVP with in time line.

Today was long but productive, i did a lot of data parseing and looking at spoons documentation. i have the road to CRUD paved and im ready to implement my Recipe db tomorrow. still need to figure out if i need to move my db for users from auth0 or if i just want to make one of my own along side for basic user linking to user save recipes.

spotify is with in reach as is mvp being on time.. i belive i will have functionality by end of day tomorrow and then spend 2 days on css.
