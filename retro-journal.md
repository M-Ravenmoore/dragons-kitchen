Today i actualy shoped wireframing tools instead of hand drawing them on my tablet and i like some of the sofwares but the seem very browser dependant sadly... i can do much the same things with gimp however i found cacoo.. not abad one neither is ninja..  im still on the fence untill i can get the full versions from an future employer or pay.

i feel like i have a good foundation to spring in to code tomorrow and but may start my day working on some more ground work like a flow chart for the db and api calls and how i want the data to flow... i think i need to white board that one and then clean it up in cacoo.com
