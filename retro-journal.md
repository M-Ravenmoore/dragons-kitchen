Today i actualy shoped wireframing tools instead of hand drawing them on my tablet and i like some of the sofwares but the seem very browser dependant sadly... i can do much the same things with gimp however i found cacoo.. not abad one neither is ninja..  im still on the fence untill i can get the full versions from an future employer or pay.

i feel like i have a good foundation to spring in to code tomorrow and but may start my day working on some more ground work like a flow chart for the db and api calls and how i want the data to flow... i think i need to white board that one and then clean it up in cacoo.com

Today was tricky authorization is fun but hard i know im pushing topics i have yet to cover but i want this to work so i will put the time and energy into making this work so i have a good head start at 401 in december.
i feel i did a lot of solid work in my views today got some simple js working with a slide show and a few menu transitions for mobile design.

all in all a good programing day i got a lot of headway to my auth system. need to make a login prompt for existing users either a page or a on page prompt that changes.... that is something to look in to is chaning an element on login..

i think tomorrow will be api calls for the recipes and userdata handling.
